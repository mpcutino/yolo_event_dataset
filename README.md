### **Pipeline of work**

In *bag_related.py* file there is the code that reads images from a ros bag, 
writes them in disk and get the bounding boxes according to YOLO detection. 
The output from YOLO should be reviewed. If there are some missing detections,
then use [INSERT REFERENCE] fro manually put the bounding boxes.
